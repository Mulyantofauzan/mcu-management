- Session stored in sessionStorage (needs HTTP-only cookies)
- No CSRF protection on forms
- Rate limiting only on frontend (needs backend)
- No server-side input validation

### Scalability
- Works well with up to 5,000 records
- Beyond that: needs pagination optimization
- Beyond 10,000: needs database query optimization

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires ES6+ support
- Progressive enhancement possible if needed
