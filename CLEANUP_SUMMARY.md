## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Week 1 Database Migration
The database migration script (`001_add_mfa_and_audit_logging.sql`) is still in:
```
database/migrations/001_add_mfa_and_audit_logging.sql
```

If you want to completely clean up the database:
1. Keep this file for reference
2. Run `CLEANUP_SUPABASE.sql` to drop the audit tables
3. Or manually drop tables in Supabase

### If You Want to Re-apply Week 1 Features
All Week 1 code is still available in earlier commits:
```bash
git log --oneline | grep "Week 1"
```

To restore any Week 1 feature:
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
